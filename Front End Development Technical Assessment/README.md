# üìö JavaScript Course Projects ‚Äî Scrimba Challenge

Welcome! This repository contains my completed projects for the **JavaScript course by Scrimba**, as part of the JavaScript pre-training assessment.

The goal of this task was to demonstrate the ability to **learn independently**, follow along with a course, and complete three guided JavaScript mini-projects. I enjoyed the process and challenged myself to understand both the *how* and the *why* behind each implementation.

## üß† What This Is

As part of the application process for the **GSG JavaScript Course**, we were asked to:

1. Watch the [Scrimba JavaScript Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) or its [YouTube version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M).
2. Build three hands-on projects by following the instructor.
3. Upload the code to GitHub and share the links.
