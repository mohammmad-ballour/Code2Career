# ðŸŒŸ Personal Portfolio â€” HTML & CSS Assessment

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project was created as part of an HTML & CSS assessment task. Itâ€™s built using only HTML and CSS â€” no external libraries or frameworks involved. The site introduces who I am, why Iâ€™m applying for the program, and how you can get in touch with me.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This is a simple yet thoughtfully designed static website that reflects my personality and motivation. I focused on clean code, responsiveness, and visual clarity. You're welcome to explore the source code and see how everything was built from the ground up!
